# There is an area around each magnet corresponding the possible positions of the pick-up arm
# An over-sized rectangle is calculated to encompass this area.
# For two magnets to overlap, their center-center distance must be at least smaller than the  diagonal of the
# over-sized rectangle.
# The diagonal is calculated from the center of the over-sized rectangle area (center of the magnet xi,yi)
# to the corner.

# First let's calculate the size of the over-sized rectangle
